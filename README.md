# Cryptography Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various cryptographic algorithms that I am studying in my university cryptography course. The goal is to provide a clear and concise implementation of each algorithm along with explanations of how they work.

## Implemented Algorithms

### Caesar Cipher
The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

You can find the implementation of the Caesar Cipher in the `caesar_cipher.py` file.

### Transposition Cipher
The Transposition Cipher works by rearranging the characters of the plaintext according to a specific system. In this implementation, a columnar transposition cipher is used.

You can find the implementation of the Transposition Cipher in the `transposition_cipher.py` file.

#### Usage:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cryptography-algorithms.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the folder containing the implementation.
3. Run the scripts:
    ```bash
    python caesar_cipher.py
    python transposition_cipher.py
    ```

## How to Use
Each algorithm is implemented as a standalone Python script. You can run them individually by following the instructions provided in the corresponding script files. 

## Contributing
Feel free to fork the repository, create a branch, and make contributions or improvements to the code.
